        I'm a Ph.D. Candidate and Graduate Research Assistant at the
        <a href="https://sci.utah.edu"> Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute</a>
        at the
        University of Utah, working with Prof. Martin Berzins.
        Before joining the Ph.D. program at Utah, I worked as a
        "Software Engineer" at Wipro Technologies from 2006 to 2011 and later
        with Deloitte as a "Senior Analyst" and "Technical Architect"
        from 2011 to 2015. I obtained a B.E. in Computer Engineering in 2006
        at the University of Pune. My research interests cover a range of
        areas in High Performance Computing, including large scale computing
        using MPI, GPU Programming, multi-threading, portability, performance
        optimizations, and resiliency.

        The frequency of failures in upcoming exascale supercomputers may well
        be greater than at present due to many-core architectures if component
        failure rates remain unchanged. This potential increase in failure frequency
        coupled with I/O challenges at exascale may prove problematic for current
        resiliency approaches such as checkpoint restarting, although the use of
        fast intermediate memory may help. Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT)
        using Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) is one resiliency approach used to
        address these challenges. For adaptive mesh codes, a coarse mesh version
        of the solution may be used to restore the fine mesh solution. This paper
        addresses the implementation of theABFT approach within the Uintah software
        framework: both at a software level within Uintah and in the data reconstruction
        method used for the recovery of lost data. This method has two problems:
        inaccuracies introduced during the reconstruction propagate forward in time,
        and the physical consistency of variables such as positivity or boundedness
        may be violated during interpolation. These challenges can be addressed by
        the combination of two techniques: 1. a fault-tolerant MPI implementation
        to recover from runtime node failures, and 2. high-order interpolation schemes
        to preserve the physical solution and reconstruct lost data. The approach
        considered here uses a "Limited Essentially Non-Oscillatory"(LENO) scheme
        along with AMR to rebuild the lost data without checkpointing using Uintah.
        Experiments were carried out using a fault-tolerant MPI - ULFM to recover from
        runtime failure, and LENO to recover data on patches belonging to failed ranks,
        while the simulation was continued to the end. Results show that this ABFT
        approach is up to 10x faster than the traditional checkpointing method.
        The new interpolation approach is more accurate than linear interpolation
        and not subject to the overshoots found in other interpolation methods.

      fine patches F0, F1, F2, and F3 and coarse patches C0, C1, C2, and C3. When
      ranks R0 and R2 crash, the surviving ranks R1 and R3 take over, are renamed
      to R0 and R1. The surviving ranks now interpolate missing patches F0 and F2
      from coarse patch C0 and C2 and continue the simulation.

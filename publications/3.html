        The solution of large-scale combustion problems with codes such as the
        Arches component of Uintah on next-generation computer architectures
        requires using a many and multi-core threaded approach and/or GPUs to
        achieve performance. Such codes often use a low-Mach number approximation
        that requires the iterative solution of a large system of linear equations
        at every time step. While the discretization routines in such a code can
        be improved by using, say, OpenMP or Cuda approaches, it is important that
        the linear solver be able to perform well too. For Uintah the Hypre iterative
        solver has proved to solve such systems in a scalable way. The use of Hypre
        with OpenMP leads to at least 2xslowdownsdue to OpenMP overheads, however.
        This behavior is analyzed, and a solution proposed by using the MPI Endpoints
        approach is implemented within Hypre, where each team of threads acts as a
        different MPI rank. This approach minimized OpenMP synchronization overhead,
        avoided slowdowns, performed as fast or (up to 1.5x) faster than Hypreâ€™s MPI
        only version, and allowed the rest of Uintah to be optimized using OpenMP.
        Profiling of the GPU version of Hypreshowed the bottleneck to be the launch
        overhead of thousands of micro-kernels.The GPU performance was improved by
        fusing these micro kernels and was further optimized by using Cuda-aware
        MPI. The overall speedup of 1.26x to 1.44xwas observed compared to the
        baseline GPU implementation.

        Figure 1: Using OpenMP across cell iterators requires thousands of OpenMP thread
        synchronizations as shown in Figure a. The synchronization overhead can not be
        justified for small loops. The alternate strategy of MPI EndPoint (MPI EP), where
        each thread (or a team of threads) acts as an MPI rank, is shown in Figure b.

        (this work) and overall simulation. The MPI EP avoids slowdowns observed in
        the default OpenMP version of the solver (Figure b) and improves overall simulation time
        (Figure c).

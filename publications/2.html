          As computer architectures are rapidly evolving (e.g. those designed for
          exascale), multiple portability frameworks have been developed to avoid
          new architecture-specific development and tuning.
          However, portability frameworks depend on compilers for auto-vectorization and
          may lack support for explicit vectorization on heterogeneous platforms.
          Alternatively, programmers can use intrinsics-based primitives to achieve more
          efficient vectorization, but the lack of a GPU back-end for these
          primitives makes such code non-portable. A unified, portable, Single
          Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) primitive proposed in this work,
          allows intrinsics-based vectorization on CPUs and many-core
          architectures such as Intel Knights Landing (KNL), and also facilitates
          Single Instruction Multiple Threads (SIMT) based execution on
          GPUs. This unified primitive, coupled with the Kokkos portability
          ecosystem, makes it possible to develop explicitly vectorized code, which is
          portable across heterogeneous platforms. The new SIMD primitive is
          used on different architectures to test the performance boost against
          hard-to-auto-vectorize baseline, to measure the overhead against efficiently
          vectroized baseline, and to evaluate the new feature called the  “logical vector
          length” (LVL). The SIMD primitive provides portability across
          CPUs and GPUs without any performance degradation being
          observed experimentally.

        Fig 1: Figure a. shows the mapping of Kokkos' hierarchical  parallelism to OpenMP
        and CUDA without using the SIMD primitive. Figure b. shows the missing CUDA backend
        for the SIMD primitive, which does not let Kokkos use such primitives for efficient
        vectorization. This missing piece is added as part of this work.

            <p>
              I'm a <b>Ph.D. candidate</b>  and <b>Graduate Research Assistant</b> at the
              <a href="https://sci.utah.edu"> Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute</a>
              at the <a href="https://cs.utah.edu">University of Utah</a>,
              working with Prof. <a href="https://www.sci.utah.edu/people/mb.html">Martin Berzins</a>
              from 2016. Before joining the Ph.D. program, I worked for
              <b>9 years</b> in the <b>software development</b>
              - initially as a
              <b>Software Engineer</b> at <a href="https://www.wipro.com/en-US/">Wipro Technologies</a>
              from 2006 to 2011, and later as a <b>Technical Architect</b> with
              <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html">Deloitte</a>
              from 2011 to 2015. While working as an Architect, I got more
              interested in the scalability and performance aspects of software.
              What can be better scaling and performance tuning opportunities than
              on 1000s of nodes on a supercomputer! With that aim in mind,
              I embarked upon my doctoral journey in August 2015.
              <!-- I obtained a B.E. in Computer Engineering in 2006 at the University of Pune, India. -->

              I'm a <b>Graduate Research Assistant</b> at the
              <a href="https://sci.utah.edu"> Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute</a>
              at the <a href="https://cs.utah.edu">University of Utah</a>,
              working with Prof. <a href="https://www.sci.utah.edu/people/mb.html">Martin Berzins</a>.
              Before joining the Ph.D. program at Utah, I worked as a
              <b>Software Engineer</b> at <a href="https://www.wipro.com/en-US/">Wipro Technologies</a>
              from 2006 to 2011, and later with
              <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html">Deloitte</a>
              as a <b>Senior Analyst</b> and <b>Technical Architect</b>
              from 2011 to 2015. I obtained a B.E. in Computer Engineering in 2006
              at the University of Pune. My research interests cover a range of
              areas in High Performance Computing, including massively parallel solutions for
              complex science problems,  GPU Programming, multi-threading,
              performance portability across modern multi-core and many core architectures,
              performance optimizations, and resiliency.

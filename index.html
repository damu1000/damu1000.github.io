              at the <a href="https://cs.utah.edu">University of Utah</a>,
              working with Prof. <a href="https://www.sci.utah.edu/people/mb.html">Martin Berzins</a>
              from 2016. I worked for
              <b>9 years</b> in the <b>software development industry</b>
              - initially as a
              <b>Software Engineer</b> at <a href="https://www.wipro.com/en-US/">Wipro Technologies</a>
              from 2006 to 2011, and later as a <b>Technical Architect</b> with

              My research interests cover a range of areas in High Performance Computing (HPC),
              including utilization GPUs and
              multi-threading for performance gains, development of efficient programming models
              for GPU and/or multithreaded environments, massively parallel solutions for
              the complex scientific problems, performance portability across modern
              multi-core and many core architectures,
              performance optimizations, asynchronous many task runtime systems, and resiliency.

              Before joining the Ph.D. program, I <b>worked in the software development industry for 9 years</b>
              from 2006 till 2015.
              During this time, I learned and contributed to software architecture,
              system integration, software design and development, and master data management.
              While working as a Technical Architect with Deloitte, I got more
              excited about the scalability and performance aspects of software.
              Eager to learn more about the latest technologies and to explore
              the research environment, I embarked upon my doctoral journey in August 2015.

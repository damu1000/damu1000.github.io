              I'm a <b>Graduate Research Assistant</b> at the
              <a href="https://sci.utah.edu"> Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute</a>
              at the <a href="https://cs.utah.edu">University of Utah</a>,
              working with Prof. <a href="https://www.sci.utah.edu/people/mb.html">Martin Berzins</a>.
              Before joining the Ph.D. program at Utah in 2015, I worked for
              <b>nine years</b> in the <b>software development industry</b>
              - initially as a
              <b>Software Engineer</b> at <a href="https://www.wipro.com/en-US/">Wipro Technologies</a>
              from 2006 to 2011, and later as a <b>Technical Architect</b> with
              <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html">Deloitte</a>
              from 2011 to 2015. I obtained a B.E. in Computer Engineering in 2006
              at the University of Pune, India. My research interests cover a range of
              areas in High Performance Computing, including utilization GPUs and
              multi-threading for performance gains, development of efficient programming models
              for GPU and/or multithreaded environments, massively parallel solutions for
              the complex scientific problems, performance portability across modern
              multi-core and many core architectures,
              performance optimizations, asynchronous many task runtime systems, and resiliency.

<!--
Steps to add new publication:
1. Add a new entry AT THE TOP of _data/publications.yml by copying previous entry. Increment "id"
2. Add a new page into publications/ by copying existing page. "id" in publications.yml MUST match the name of html page and "pub" in the html.

              <b>I worked in the software development industry for nine years.</b>
              During this time, I learned and contributed to software architecture,
              system integration, software design and development, and master data management.
              While working as a Technical Architect with Deloitte, I got more
              excited about the scalability and performance aspects of software.
              Eager to learn more about the latest technologies and to explore
              the research environment, I embarked upon my doctoral journey in August 2015.

              Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed a few classes, including

              Before joining the Ph.D. program, I worked in the software development industry for 9 years.
              I learned and contributed to:
              <ul>
               <li>Software architecture</li>
               <li>System integration</li>
               <li>Software design and development</li>
               <li>Master data management</li>
               <li>Application performance tuning</li>
             </ul>
             </p>
              <p>While working as a Technical Architect with Deloitte, I got more
              interested in the scalability and performance aspects of software.
              What can be a better scaling and performance tuning opportunities than
              on 1000s of nodes on a supercomputer! With that aim in mind,
              I embarked upon my doctoral journey in August 2015.</p>
